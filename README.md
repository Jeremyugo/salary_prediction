# Salary Prediction

Online job boards have become the preferred method of applying for positions in comoanies, however most of the openings listed on these job boards have no salary benefits details and this has troubled job seekers who are tired of going through the stress of applying for jobs, attending the interview only to realise that the remuneration is below what they expected.

This project is aimed at providing a means for job seekers to find out what salary they might expect based on certain factors like; Work Experience, Degree, Major, Job Type, Industry and distance from the city.

This project was carried out with an assumption that the companies in the dataset are leasing companies in their respective industries e.g BP, SHELL, CHEVRON, MERCEDES BENZ, TESLA, BMW, KPMG, EY, PWC, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, APPLE etc. In this notebook, we will go through how i tackled this problem. We will also see Data Visualizations, Data wrangling, Modeling and Model Deployment.
